Welcome to the Stronghold-Firewall about page!

We are utilizing Pycharm to program a Graphical User Interface, designed to write UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) rules for you.

All YOU have to do, is input data and select a few options. Our program will do the rest for you.

Our Stronghold-Firewall is user friendly so if you make a few mistakes we will let you know!:)

Hopefully we can make the uncomplicated firewall a little less complicated and your life easier.

Please leave comments, and report errors if you happen to stumble on them. Thank you and enjoy!!!
